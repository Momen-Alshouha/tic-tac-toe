# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Windows Forms in C#. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the opponent does.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Players take turns clicking on empty spaces to place their mark (X or O).
- Win detection: The game automatically detects when a player achieves three marks in a row and declares them as the winner.
- Draw detection: If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game declares a draw.
